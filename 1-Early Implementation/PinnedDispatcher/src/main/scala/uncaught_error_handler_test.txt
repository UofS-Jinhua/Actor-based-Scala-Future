Possible way

    valid

        FutureActor could create a new thread for long-run computation, and it could be terminated by Thread.stop()


        To DO => Done
            let worker actor to create a new thread for running the code block (and use thread.stop to stop it when necessary)
    

    invalid (currently)

        CustomPinnedDispatcher => not working

        CustomThreadPoolExecutor => not working 

incorrect way (probably)

    Modifying PreStart for futureActor

    Modifying Supervision strategy
