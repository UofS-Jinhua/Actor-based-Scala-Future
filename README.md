## Thesis Overview

In this thesis, I explore the challenges and solutions associated with mixing different concurrency models in Scala. The primary focus is on implementing futures using the pure Actor Model to achieve better concurrency and performance.

## Repository Contents

- `early_implementation/`: Contains early implementations of the actor-based futures.
- `final_implementation/`: Includes the final, optimized implementation of the actor-based futures.
- `partial_implementation/`: Features partial implementations and intermediate versions developed during the research for Remote use.
- `future_examples/`: Provides examples of Scala Future.

Each folder contains several approaches used at different stages of implementation or different versions of the implementation, including optimized versions.
